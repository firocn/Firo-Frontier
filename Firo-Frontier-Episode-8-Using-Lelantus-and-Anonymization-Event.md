Hello everyone and welcome back to the Firo Frontier.

I'm your host Spline Apple and it is my privilege this week to discuss our wallets and Lelantus.

I know what you're thinking though didn't he already talk a lot about those things already?

And yes I have but I haven't shown it to you.

That's right today we're actually going to showcase our technology in action and I hope you're ready.

Before we jump into the bulk of this demo I first want to highlight our ongoing contest to celebrate Lelantus being reactivated.

We are holding a community event throughout the month.

We want to encourage you all to anonymize as much of your funds as possible.

And to do that we will be crediting prizes directly to random addresses that do so.

The exact specifics are on our website as usual.

But just know that the larger the amount that is anonymized the higher the chance you have to win.

Also only the [Lelantusment] above one Firo qualify and [lulantis-j-minutes] are not counted.

There's a host of prizes to win from so get anonymizing.

And with that let's jump on into the demos.

The first thing I want to point out is that there are currently three wallets available for download on the website.

In this video we will be focusing on the QT wallet and the Electron wallet since Electron is a light wallet it doesn't
have all the capabilities that we want to showcase.

That doesn't mean that it isn't useful in its own way though.

But alright enough chit chat let's look at the wallets.

So here we have the QT wallet which is the high security option we have to offer.

If you look at the top of the window you'll see that we have several tabs the overview tab the send tab the receive
tab the transaction tab and the masternode tab.

They're pretty self-explanatory.

Let's look at receiving real quick.

I'm going to request a payment and a new window will pop up.

We now have a few ways to request that payment the QR code the URI or just the address.

I am sending money to myself for this video so I will just be using the address.

So I sent myself some Firo and I'll go to the overview tab notice that I'm being sent about 10.5 transparent Firo.

I know that this transaction is still being mined because it is in the pending section.

It'll take a bit of time so I'll skip ahead a few minutes.

Once the transaction goes through you'll notice that the 10.5 Firo I sent is now in the available
balance for me to spend.

However I don't want to spend transparent Firo so I'll just hit the anonymize all button
which is just begging to be pressed.

Upon clicking the button I am prompted for my passphrase make extra sure that you have this stored securely somewhere.

I made this dummy wallet just for the Firo Frontier.

So I'm able to get away with having it on a text document to the side.

Regardless once I put in the passphrase I can anonymize my funds I can lock the wallet after this if I
choose but i'll skip that this time around.

Now you can clearly see that my private balance increased it's still pending because the anonymization
takes a minute but it will move to the available private balance very soon.

A quick tip it's wise to anonymize your funds whenever you can if you only anonymize your funds just
before you want to make a transaction that increases the risk of some adversary finding a time correlation
in the blockchain.

So keep as much of your balance anonymized as possible and do it often.

Speaking of the blockchain let's see what my transaction actually looks like on a blockchain explorer.

Let's go to the transaction tab and double click on the transaction in question.

This will pull up various details including the transaction ID which I'll just copy.

NOW I'm going to pull up an internet browser go to this website and paste the transaction ID in the search bar.

And voila we have the ID the size the fee and other information about this transaction.

We can also scroll down to see a little more info if we want.

Now let's see what it looks like to send some Firo through the QT wallet.

By hopping on over to the send tab I actually have the address I'm sending to.

Since I'm just sending it to myself so I'll paste that in.

Notice the three buttons on the side of the address bar.

These are just here to help if you want.

For your bookkeeping needs you can add a label to the transaction like bill gift what have you.

I'm just going to put in Firo Frontier.

Also if you look at the bottom right of the screen you can see the option to use some of
your transparent balance.

I won't do that right now but I just want to point it out.

Put the amount you want to send.

I'm just going to subtract the fee from the amount.

And there we go.

As always your passphrase is required and once you put that in you just need one more confirmation and
you're good to go. 

Let's hop on over to the overview tab again and see what updated.

If we pretend I didn't just send to myself we can now see that I have about 10 transparent Firo And it's as simple as that.

Before we move on to the Electron wallet I just want to mention that you shouldn't spend the exact same amount
that you anonymized.

It's much wiser to spend less than that.

This is because if you anonymize 10 Firo and then spend that 10 private Firo immediately after.

It looks a little suspicious.

Again we just want to avoid anytime correlations and we want to keep your information private.

Let's open up the Electron wallet it'll take a couple seconds to initialize but good things come to those who wait.

The first thing to notice is the red statement at the top.

Until this goes away I won't be able to interact with the blockchain.

Fortunately it doesn't take very long at all and it'll just quietly disappear.

In our case however we just received some Firo so we get this clear banner prompting me to anonymize it.

Of course I'll happily oblige because one I want to keep my financial history private and two I want to be entered into the contest.

As usual once I press it I am prompted to enter my passphrase.

You'll notice that the amount I anonymize is once again pending.

I just need to wait a minute before the Firo is hidden.

While we wait let's just take a quick look at the tabs of the wallet.

We have send receive transactions and more.

Personally this wallet looks nicer to me than the other one.

A big difference between the wallets is the coin swap tab where complements of switch chain.

You can swap from and to Firo in a convenient way.

I will be sending money to myself again.

So let's go to the receive tab.

I can send my QR code or send the address.

It's really straightforward to give somebody the ability to pay you.

Also for bookkeeping I can change the name of this transaction.

Click the address to copy it into your clipboard.

Since I'm sending money to myself I go to the send tab.

Notice at the bottom right I can toggle whether I'm sending private or public Firo.

Right now I don't have any public Firo to send but I just wanted to point this out.

Because this is how Lelantus works in this wallet.

We paste the address you can actually add that address to a contact list for future use if you want.

I'll add the label and send 6.5 Firo less than I anonymized and subtract the fee from the total.

You can customize your fee and your inputs if you want as well.

I'll send it and use my passphrase one last time.

And there we go.

Okay I hope you enjoyed that little demo.

The Firo team has received quite a lot of requests on how to use Lelantus.

So we really wanted to take the opportunity this week to showcase the technology we're so proud of.

Don't forget to participate in the anonymization contest for the chance to win big.

And with that my time for this week is up.
