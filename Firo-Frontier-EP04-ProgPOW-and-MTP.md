Hi everyone it's your boy Spline Apple.

You may notice I have a different setup.

It's a little more natural and I hope you like it.

Although the studio is different the passion to inform and share news about Firo is still the same.

So without further ado let's jump on in.

For the last couple weeks we've been mostly talking about different events surrounding Firo.

Like the different promotions or the attack.

Today though we're going to be talking about something different.

Today we're going to be talking exclusively about a technology that Firo is moving to implement soon.

ProgPOW more specifically the difference between ProgPOW and something like MTP.

And the road that has led us to running to move to ProgPOW in the first place.

To start off I think we're all familiar with the concept of mining.

You know you use your processing power and energy to help add to the blockchain while also giving you a reward for your contribution.

In general there are four main ways that you can mine.

You can mine with a CPU, a GPU, an ASIC or an FPGA.

A CPU is very flexible you can use it to surf the web write documents etc.

You can do so many things with the CPU.

But that flexibility comes at a cost.

It is the least effective of the four ways to mine.

Its entry level is also pretty low because it's quite cheap.

A GPU is primarily used for rendering.

It's best suited for vector-based calculations.

It's more effective at mining than a CPU and it's also in a similar price range.

An ASIC which stands for application specific integrated circuit is essentially a computer that is designed for one thing only.

In the crypto world an ASIC is solely made to mine a specific coin.

It is extremely efficient at its job at the cost of being unable to do anything else.

An ASIC is also very difficult to just have.

They are very expensive to make which means usually companies and governments are the only ones to have access to them.

An FPGA or a field programmable gate array are kind of between a GPU and an ASIC in terms of mining power.

Similar to an ASIC an FPGA is formatted to be good at one thing in our case mining.

However while an ASIC is incapable of being repurposed an FPGA can be reprogrammed for a different task altogether or tweaked if a mining protocol changes.

The entry level of these is rather high because it requires a decent amount of technical knowledge to do that reprogramming.

In general it's within a cryptocurrency's best interest to be distributed pretty evenly and this is especially true with the private coin like Firo.

A single ASIC is more effective than a GPU by many orders of magnitude and there are only a handful of manufacturers who make them.

This is obviously a huge risk for centralization.

There are different methods to make a coin ASIC resistant.

For example you could consistently change the mining protocol to make an ASIC which is entirely dedicated to one job being done in one specific way to stop working properly.

This means that a brand new ASIC would have to be made.

Do this often enough and making an ASIC is just not worth the cost.

But do you remember the FPGAs?

If the mining protocol was changed slightly then FPGAs could similarly be tweaked and then they're just as effective.

Before Firo used MTP we used Lyra2Z which was very weak against FPGAs which finally brings us to MTP.

In the December of 2018 Firo known as Zcoin at the time implemented MTP or the Merkle Tree Protocol.

There's another video on the Firo channel that explains MTP but I'll be elaborating a little bit.

The biggest quality of MTP is that it is memory intensive.

The reasoning behind this is that such a memory hard algorithm is hard to optimize which lowers the extreme advantage that ASICs have.

It has been a standard for private cryptocurrencies to use such algorithms for quite a while.

However in recent years algorithms which rely solely on the memory requirements to exclude specialized hardware just isn't enough anymore and that leads us to ProgPOW.

The newest generation in the never-ending fight to decentralize a currency.

To help contextualize what ProgPOW does it'll probably help to know that unlike past algorithms which were designed to be ASIC resistant ProgPOW is more focused on optimizing itself for GPUs.

So rather than designing against specialized hardware.

We're actually designing specifically for accessible hardware.

The difference is very subtle but hugely important.

Because of how an ASIC is made.

When making an ASIC you must decide first the task that you want to do.

From there you assemble the hardware in such a way that you only use what you need for the task.

Any part that won't add to its effectiveness is not necessary.

Because ProgPOW is designed specifically for GPUs.

An ASIC manufacturer wouldn't be doing anything new.

They'd just be making another GPU which levels out the mining distribution tremendously and of course you can't talk about ProgPOW without talking about the proof size.

MTP proofs are about 200 kilobytes which bloat the blockchain and add strain to the network.

ProgPOW on the other hand has a proof size around 64 bytes.

That's around point zero three percent.

This means that in years to come any newcomer to Firo won't have to worry about downloading some massive blockchain to even use it and since Firo is a coin for everybody that's a pretty big deal.

It also opens the door to faster blocktime if required.

There are several videos and articles which go into even more detailed about the mechanics of ProgPOW and we'll link some of them in the description.

Our hope here at the Firo Frontier was to interest you just enough to maybe start doing some research yourself.

If you do want a more in-depth look at ProgPOW something else in a more technical sense.

Let us know in the comments but for now please like the video and subscribe to the channel.

We are a full month into the Firo Frontier and we're just getting started.

This is Spline Apple signing off.
