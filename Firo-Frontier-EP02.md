Hi everyone, Spline Apple here and welcome back to the Firo Frontier.

[Music]

Alright so last week on the Firo Frontier we had a lot of updates primarily dealing with our technology.

Please make sure to give that a watch because what we covered is still very relevant.

One correction that i did want to make about our last video though is regarding the section on confirmations.

We made a mistake.

Firo actually used to use six confirmations and we reduced to two.

Here at the Firo Frontier we take mistakes like that very seriously so please accept our most humble apologies.

This week I'm here to share what's happening in the community and stuff that everyone can get involved in.

First off, we are looking for businesses that accept firo to be featured on our social media.

And because the Firo Frontier is part of our social media.

I have a couple of shout outs I'd like to make.

Are you tired of being cooped up at home because COVID has ruined everybody's social life.

I know you're just aching to travel once things open up.

And wouldn't you know it both Travala and LockTrip accept Firo when you're booking your accommodation.

If you live in toronto and need legal help, there is a small claims law firm that accepts Firo.

For specific links check out our twitter.

And if none of those options interest you because you need more of a physical tangible item
then make sure to visit this website where you can make purchases from Walmart, eBay and Amazon.

Of course using Firo.

Moving on we are entering our third week for our Hummingbot liquidity campaign on Binance.

Hummingbot is an alternative to traditional market makers and instead empowers the community to do it for themselves.

For more information please visit this website.

You provide liquidity on Binance on any of the eligible pairs and you can earn rewards in Firo.

Please try running their open-source market making bot Hummingbot.

If you're having any trouble, they have a very helpful discord.

There is a lot more going on at Binance.

Isolated Margin tradings are open, Locked Staking is also one option but they're kind of sold out at the moment.

Because they're in pretty high demand.

When there is inventory give it a look if you're interested.

I would caution you however because this is centralized since it trusts Binance.

It's also less than hosting your own but it can be good for smaller holders.

Stay informed and make the decision that works best for you that's what a private currency like ours is all about.

Up next our Masternode Relisting Proposal has been fully funded and paid thank you so much
to our supportive community because you made this happen.

Full details of the proposal can be found on our forum and the fruits of your labor can also be found at this website.

Don't forget that anyone can open a proposal requesting funding to help improve or promote Firo.

We're super excited to see what you come up with.

There are a lot more things happening in Firo and opportunities to contribute or get involved.

Our forums are an excellent place to weigh in or you could stop by our monthly community meetings on Discord.

I just wanted to say that every link or picture shown on the screen is also included in the description

Just to save you the trouble.

Don't forget to like, subscribe and hit the bell notification to see more of the Firo Frontier and
of course more about Firo in general.

See you next time ~

This is Spline Apple signing off.
