Hello and welcome to the Firo Frontier

[Music]

Alright so the Firo Frontier's kind of a new thing,
so let me break it down for you.

Every week we're going to dive into the latest news
and talk about everything Firo related.

I'm your host, Spline Apple amateur cryptographer, news anchor, impressionist
and more importantly the recent addition to the Firo team.

The biggest recent change is the activation of Chainlocks which allow
for a rapid settlement on the network.

In other words, transactions now just need one confirmation to achieve finality.

Firo is faster than ever.

Binance has taken advantage of this new tech and now credits a user's account
after just a single confirmation that said we are changing our GUI to increase our
confirmation for the Lelantus mints from one to two in order to be spent

Especially during upgrade periods Chainlocks can be desynchronized if quorums fail to form.

So the core team believes this to be essential.

This is not a permanent change mind you

We will swiftly re-establish the status quo when prudent.

Firo's lead cryptographer and resident stud Adam has been exploring how to implement self
addressing systems for Lelantus.

Currently Lelantus version 2 allows addresses which offer some recipient privacy
such as hidden transaction amounts and time stamps, but an average blockchain viewer
can still see that an address is receiving something.

Solutions are being workshopped but we're running into some drawbacks if
there are repeated payments.

Please stay tuned for future updates.

On the developer side, we've dedicated a lot of time to optimizing our code to the point
where we can easily transition to Lelantus version 2.

Some of these refactorings include stripping old zerocoin code to increase sync speed
and hd mints.

The fee calculation engines will also be optimized so that Lelantus operations
are much easier to navigate.

In regards to our wallets, Electrum is being updated and rebranded, while
still not ideal Electrum does retain Ledger Support.

So looking ahead we may need to rethink as Electrum requires a centralized architecture.

If you want to help us get our wallet tech out faster.

Well if you have the skills for it, maybe you can.

We are cautiously looking for senior C++ developers to add to the Firo team
in addition to in-house GUI resources.

But Spline Apple you say what about ProgPoW.

You want to know about ProgPoW, okay okay, ProgPoW news it is.

We've approached three separate developers for quotes, while our team is certainly
capable of this task it may be preferable to focus on things that are unique to Lelantus
and Firo since I mean after all we do know it best.

ProgPoW will also come with a reduction in block times to two and a half minutes.

Well when you know it, there's the bell.

We're out of time and that's actually a huge shame,
because there's so much more to tell you guys.

But don't worry tune back in next week to the Firo Frontier to get your weekly fix
of Firo news and updates.
